# randomWorkoutGenerator
This is a random workout generator. The goal is to create a 45 second timer to time my workouts and then a 15 second timer to rest. 
At the end of the 45 seconds, the workout randomly changes. The user will be able to select between upper body, lower body, and core.
A random number generator selects a random workout, depending on which body section you choose. This is a work in progress and welcome
any suggestions.
